            <h3>Ultimate Flexiblility</h3>
            Set cost of sale targets based on SKU, category, price, condition, or any other attribute and we'll manage the bidding to achieve maximum sales. We monitor performance in real time and can make millions of adjustments a day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="assets/imgs/illus_performance.svg" />
            <h3>Great Performance</h3>
            Find under-performing products and wasteful ad spend. We show you products where you're missing out on profitable sales due to low bidding, or where you could reduce the amount you're paying and still get the same number of sales.
          </li>
          <li>

            <h3>Saves Money</h3>
            Works to maximise results for you. Unlike with Google Ads, in Marketeer Connect the targets you set are the maximums, if we can deliver the same quantity of sales but pay less we'll adjust the bidding automatically.

We’ll give you an instant indication of how many additional sales we think we’ll send your way. Our account optimizer will then work to bring in sales under this threshold.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="faq">
      <div class="content first">
        <h3>Is there a setup fee?</h3>
        <p>No. There are no setup fees on any of our plans.</p>
        <h3>Can I cancel my account at any time?</h3>
        <p>Yes. If you ever decide that Marketeer Connect isn’t the best marketing platform for your business, simply cancel your account.</p>
        <h3>How long are your contracts?</h3>
        <p>All Marketeer Connect plans are rolling 30 day contracts.</p>
        <h3>What data does Marketeer Connect use?</h3>
        <p>Once connected, we use Google Ads reporting to understand historical performance of your products. We look back up to 3 years to see trends for your Store around the whole retail calendar. When accessing Google Ads data, we only fetch data relating to Shopping campaigns; we do not access data from Text, Display, Video or App campaigns.</p>
        <h3>Is my Marketeer Connect data secure?</h3>
        <p>Yes. All of our customer data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Each customers data is individually isolated, and all Google Ads credentials are stored with industry leading AES-256-bit encryption keys.</p>
        <h3>How long does it take to get setup?</h3>
        <p>Once you have created your Marketeer Connect account it usually takes us 5-10 minutes to get all of your historical Google Ads data and your Merchant Centre products. After the initial import has finished, you can get started straight away.</p>
        <h3>How accurate are the forecasts?</h3>
        <p>We use a combination of industry trend data, competitor inventory tracking and sales data, Google forecasting tools and finally historical performance of your own products to forecast future sales at different bid levels. All of this data is fed into our proprietary machine learning algorithms, which are constantly learning based on your actual performance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h3>Do I need an existing Google Ads account and Google Merchant Centre?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Marketeer Connect is currently designed to work for customers who have an existing Google Ads account linked with a Google Merchant Centre. You do not need to have run any previous activity, but you do need active products in Google Merchant Centre to bid on.</p>
        <h3>Can I still use the Google Ads interface?</h3>
        <p>Yes! We recommend that you still use the Google Ads interface for day to day account management. You can use the built in Google Ads reporting functionality to track the performance of our campaigns running in your account. You can also pause our campaigns and adjust budgets all from Google Ads.</p>
        <h3>Can I edit Marketeer campaigns or data in Google Ads?</h3>
        <p>You can edit the Marketeer budget to increase or decrease the total amount of money you spend on Marketeer campaigns. You can also pause, enable or delete Marketeer campaigns within your account. However you should not edit any other data such as Campaign criteria settings, Ad Groups or Product Groups. Any changes you make will be undone by our automation the next time Marketeer syncs your account. If you spot any problems in your account, or you have edited something, please contact support@marketeer.ai and we'll get it fixed.</p>
        <h3>Is there a limit to the number of products I can have in a Store?</h3>
        <p>There is no limit in Marketeer Connect, although an individual Google Ads account is limited to bidding on approximately 5,000,000 individual products. We are able to work with multiple Google Ads accounts tied to an individual Google Merchant Centre to work around this limit.</p>

        <h2>Let's <span>shake</span> things up.</h2>
        <p>Traditional marketing tools charge you a percentage of your ad spend. We believe you should just pay for the value delivered. That’s why we have straight forward pricing.</p>
        <p> Simple, right? 🤷</p>
